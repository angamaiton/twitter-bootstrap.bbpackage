Welcome to the package for twitter bootstrap
=============================================

This package attempts to gather up things related to Twitter Bootstrap 3 and BBEdit.


This package uses work gone before it:

Twitter Bootstrap Clippings
----------

The clippings on this package are based on [zacwasielewski's BBEdit-clippings-for-twitter-bootstrap on Github](https://github.com/zacwasielewski/BBEdit-Clippings-for-Twitter-Bootstrap). They have been heavily modified and (where needed) updated for Bootstrap 3.


Twitter Bootstrap Linter
--------------------

This package also makes it easy to run [bootlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootlint) on the frontmost file.

  2. `$ mkdir Packages # if it doesn't already exists`
  3. `$ cd Packages`
  4. `$ git clone https://github.com/rwilcox/twitter-bootstrap.bbpackage.git`
